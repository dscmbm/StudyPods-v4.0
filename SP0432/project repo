Problem Statement - Focus on the challenges faced by students in making informed decisions about their career paths after completing Class X

Solution: Many students encounter uncertainty and confusion when it comes to selecting a career path after Class X. With a multitude of options available across different streams—Science (PCM/PCB), Commerce, and Arts—students often lack access to comprehensive and reliable information to make informed decisions about their future. This lack of guidance can lead to anxiety, indecision, and mismatched career choices, ultimately affecting their long-term career satisfaction and success. Addressing this challenge requires a solution that provides students with clear insights into various career options, tailored roadmaps based on their individual strengths and interests, and guidance to navigate the complexities of different streams. By offering such support, we aim to empower students to make confident and well-informed decisions about their career paths, ensuring a smoother transition from secondary education to their chosen profession
